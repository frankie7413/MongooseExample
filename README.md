# MongooseExample
Mongoose tutorial based on http://mongoosejs.com/docs/ 

How to install:
1. run npm install
2. Depending where you download the program
you command for mongo would be similar to:
mongod --dbpath /Users/franktosh/Desktop/mongooseExample/data/
3. node app.js

What am I looking at?
The objects being inserted into the database and being 
query back to the user. Simple example to understand how to 
connect to mongod with mongoose, insert data, and query data.
